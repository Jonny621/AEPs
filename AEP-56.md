## Abstract

NEP-56 defines the URI format for universal storage mechanism. Describes a region code.

## Motivation

NEP repository does not want to deal with assigning the values for various regions different so we propose this AEP to become such body.


## Registered region code

Region code | Protocol    | Application    | Endpoints
